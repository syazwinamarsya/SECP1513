The talk given by the Clarity Techworks employee was a truly eye-opening experience that deepened my understanding of the 
IT world and its boundless potential. Before the session, I viewed IT as primarily technicalâ€”a field centered around coding, 
troubleshooting, and software development.Every speakers explain about their job scope and what skills 
should we focus during our 4 years study.One of the speakers said that we as a student should focus more on our soft skills and
communications skills so it is easier during our working phase to interact with both clients and stakeholders.
In the poster,I wanted to ensure I provide all the elements during the talk and make it easier to read and 
I choose a simple and clean template to make it compact and full of information.
