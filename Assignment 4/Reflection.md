Attending the PowerBI workshop by Dr Haslina Hashim really taught me so many things.I am a Computer Network and Security student but I have much more interest in data field when the first time I wen to this workshop.I know it is not going to be an easy journey for me in this industry but having a good fundamental solution will help me throught this 4 years of journey in UTM.I learn a lot from this workshop.For example,I learn about the key topics on how to use every elements in PowerBI tools such as foreign key,DAX and slicer.I hope in the upcoming semester,there is more workshops that will held by my faculty or external organization so I can keep learning.
