Building a PC was an exciting and educational experience. I learned how to assemble key components like the motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, and storage, as well as how to connect them properly. Understanding how each part works and fits together helped me appreciate the design and functionality of computers. One of the most important parts of the process was troubleshooting. When something didnâ€™t work right, I had to check connections, settings, and compatibility, which taught me patience and problem-solving skills. I also learned about the importance of cable management and airflow for a clean and efficient build. Overall, assembling a PC gave me both confidence and practical skills that will be helpful in future projects, whether for personal use or helping others. It was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of computers.
