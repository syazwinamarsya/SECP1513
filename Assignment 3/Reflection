Reflecting on the valuable insights shared by Mr. Mohd Hakimi Iqmall and Mr. Nik Mohd Habibullah, I recognize the importance
of developing both technical and soft skills to succeed in the field of computer science. Mr. Hakimi's emphasis 
on mastering programming languages, understanding database structures, and refining problem-solving and debugging skills aligns
with the technical foundation needed for success. Additionally, the focus on soft skills like communication, teamwork, 
and leadership is crucial for navigating the demands of the industry. Meanwhile, Mr. Nikâ€™s IRPA method and advice on 
building an authentic resume and evaluating market dynamics offer practical guidance for career development 
and entrepreneurship. I plan to follow this advice by honing my technical expertise in programming and algorithms, 
participating in projects and hackathons to gain hands-on experience, and enhancing my interpersonal skills 
through group work and networking. Understanding the balance between technical knowledge and soft skills will be key
to ensuring my success in an ever-evolving industry.
